    """This class tests a great deal of the functionality provided by the Clock class.
    Some assumptions were made with the tests that are specific to the instructor solution.
    Depending on how you write some of your methods, your code might not pass the tests.
    For example, these tests assume the __str__() method returns a string that has the
    hour, minute, and second separated by colons AND with no leading zeroes if a minute
    or second is single digits.
    In addition, some tests for set_hour, set_minute, advance_hour, advance_minute, __eq__()
    and __lt__() test for unexpected types (things that are not Clock objects). These
    tests look for some form of an exception to be raised. You have to look at the tests to
    see the type of exception they look for. If you want your code to pass these tests you will
    need to raise the same kind of exceptions in your code."""
